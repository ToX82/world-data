World Data (ISO Standards) - SQL Tables
=======================================

Any developer that works with an international user base will eventually need to determine what country their users are from, what language they speak and read, and sometimes even what currency their users make purchases in. The best way to keep track of that information is to follow the standards set forth by [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](http://www.iso.org/), which have become universally accepted since their development in the 1960s and 1970s. The SQL queries compiled here will populate a database with world data based on ISO standards.
